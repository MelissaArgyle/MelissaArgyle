# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Melissa Argyle

## About Me
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in turning coffee into code. When I'm not puzzling over code, you'll find me channeling my inner Picasso with a paintbrush in hand.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make my code bug-free. It's a work in progress.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Carrier pigeon is preferred, but email works too: argylemelis@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can type at 120 WPM with a bunny on my lap. Challenge me!
